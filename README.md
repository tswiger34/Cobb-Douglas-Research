This is my current research into whether or not the Cobb-Douglas production function has useful baseball applications. I outline everything in my research paper
including the methodologies I will use along with the brackground and reasoning behind why I believe this may be useful. I am currently on the data collection stage as
of 12/3/2022. I will keep this file updated with where I am currently at in the process. I started this project 11/30/2022.
